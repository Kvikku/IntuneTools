# IntuneTools

This is a WinUI 3 version of this application - https://github.com/Kvikku/IntuneAssignments.

Content is being migrated and this version will eventually replace the older Winforms based application.


# Overview

This application aims to solve one big issue I've had with Microsoft Intune for a long time - how to efficiently deploy a large amount of applications and profiles/policies to one or more groups with just a few clicks.

Usually this process involves a lot of manual work and mouse clicks, which in turn increases the probability for human error.

__With this application you can now effectively deploy a large number of applications and policies to multiple groups in seconds. There are also additional functionality available, such as updating the description property of all objects, and deleting assignments in bulk__

With this app you can:

1. Tenant to Tenant migration (copy) of Intune content.
2. Deploy a large amount of groups to a large amount of profiles and applications effectively
3. Delete assignment for a large amount of groups to a large amount of profiles and applications effectively
4. Update the description property of a large amount of profiles and applications effectively

And before you ask - No, we don't talk about policy sets in Intune. Policy sets is missing a lot of features and is quite buggy, in my honest opinion.


__NOTE - This application is a work in progress. Errors, crashes and unexpected behaviour can occur__
